        üçé Apple-Cation: Designing an Apple Classification Tool

        <b>ü§î Problem Space</b>
        <p class="tldr">In the homebrewing scene, the Pacific Northwest is famed for both its
        hops and its apple cultivars. Out here, beer may be locally-sourced,
        but cider's supply chain is long--the PNW imports many of the
        fruits it uses to make cider from other countries.</p>

        <p class="tldr"><b>Cidermakers (and researchers)</b> are interested in identifying old growth
        orchards and apple trees to impart new flavors into their brews.
        They look for quintessentially American <em>terroir</em>, but don't
        necessarily have time to hunt down particular fruiting trees themselves.</p>

        <p class="tldr">Separately, <b>hobbyist naturalists</b> might be interested in the cultivation and maintenance of
        trees in the field. They probably care about trees, but are not expert enough to identify particular varieties themselves.</p>

        <p>My partner Drew and I sought to answer the following question: <em>how might
        we involve citizen scientists in the aggregation and annotation of data about
        apple trees?</em></p>
              </div>
      <div class="section writing" id="writing">
        <b>üìù Initial Research</b>
            <p>We started the project by exploring the design space through literature review and interviews.</p>

            <p class="tldr">Our strategy to narrow down our design space involved both contextual inquiry
            (to better understand the practical work that goes into working with fruit)
            and traditional interviews (to understand the theoretical models and terminology
            experts employ).</p>

            <p class="tldr">We initially thought that we would want to teach people how to
            identify fruit in the field, letting researchers know that a particular
            tree was worth making the trip out to see. We decided to tag along with some researchers
            while they did some field work.</p>

            <p class="tldr">We wanted to observe tree-related work being done <em>in situ</em>,
            to contextualize some of the things experts think about when identifying fruits.</p>

          <b>‚úã Intervention</b>
              <p class="tldr">Coordinating people to take care of orchards is a pain point
                that stakeholders frequently feel. It is difficult for arborists to
                teach people to prune correctly and harder still to prevent over-pruning
                of trees, especially if the orchard is not privately owned or commercially operated.<p>

                <p>We found that cider-makers and aligned researchers can
                  benefit from a system that enables a broader, distributed workforce assisting
                  their efforts in the field. They need a way to <b>share knowledge</b> about trees.</p>

                  <p class="tldr">From our literature review, we found
                    that there is not an all-in-one tool that assists people in the
                    classification of trees or fruits. Existing solutions
                    are highly detailed/precise, often use technical or scientific language
                    that might not be familiar to people without domain expertise, and are
                    not mobile-friendly. This is an issue for us--the apple aficionado
                    with limited domain expertise is left out.</p>
                  <p class="tldr">Our goal was to harness the power of
                    citizen scientists to to geolocate, photograph and measure, and
                    definitively identify apple trees using a mobile interface.</p>

                  <p>We created a <b>paper prototype</b> to test the logic and user flow of our
                    classification to see if users could correctly identify attributes
                    in the field. </p>

                    <section class="tldr">We also created a demo ‚Äòdatabase‚Äô with five types of apples
                    in it, entered their possible identification attributes, and developed
                    a logical flow to classify an example apple in five steps or less.</p>

            <b>üé® Design & Refine</b>
            <p>The goal for our first prototype was to help people unfamiliar with trees or
              fruits sufficiently classify them.</p>
              <p class="tldr"> We created a robust testing methodology
              and procedure, trying our our prototype over 6 individuals with varying degrees
             of knowledge about apples. We collected both qualitative and quantitative feedback.
            After completing user testing, we also asked our users to help us make our design better.</p>
             <p>We found we can accurately predict apples a
               little bit better than chance, which was worse than expected.</p>
               <p class="tldr"> Unfortunately, we do not have a very discriminating classifier
               (the most important metric for us, since we want to minimize false positives and
               false negatives, to support better data for researchers).</p>
            <p class="tldr">Follow-up interviews with experts suggested that documenting information
              about trees that would be simultaneously useful for researchers but salient by
              the average person is a thorny problem.</p>
              <p class="tldr">Moreover, they let us know that longitudinal analysis of trees is
                something that is hard to come by, but also contributes significantly to the
                knowledge a researcher might have about fruit quality or viability</p>
                <p>So we decided to pivot, reconceptualizing our design.</p>

              <b>üì± Prototype 2.0</b>
              <p>The goal for our second prototype was to turn the process of documenting trees into an AR game.</p>
                <p> In order to test the efficacy of this system, we created a prototype
                  of a mobile user-interface in Balsamiq that a user can navigate through in order to record specific
                  attributes of a tree, as well as other specific tasks related to documentation.</p>
               <p>We attempted to create a user interface that made adding information about trees fun for users.</p>
                 <p> We performed more user testing, to see if a user
                   could sufficiently navigate a mobile interface when prompted with a task in natural language, or
                describe their interaction with the prototype using a "talk aloud" or "think aloud" process.</p>
                <img class="figure tldr" src="./img/apple-3.png">
                  <p>We found that users really enjoyed the process of documenting trees but had trouble understanding a few things:
                  namely, transitioning between the augmented reality's first-person view and the bird's eye view of the map.</p>

                <b>üï∞ Future Work</b>
                <p>In subsequent iterations, we hope to address data quality and privacy issues in our project.</p>
                <p class="tldr">Enabling researchers to understand individual
                  trees and orchards over time is an important part of the project we didn't get to address.
                  We would like to change the design of our UI to help people to
                  better understand and encourage the collection of longitudinal data.</p>

                  <p class="tldr">We changed the way data is aggregated on the backend to address her concern.</p>
