            <h1>"ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bio"</h1>
            <p>I've gotten several requests recently for a bio that captures my skills and abilities, so here's two. Clicking the tl;dr button will shorten it from ~75 to ~25 words. The 25-word bio is also less than 200 characters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><details><summary>Kevin McCraney is a data engineer, educator, and consultant. He works with public sector &amp; large-scale institutions building data processing infrastructure &amp; improving data literacy.</summary><br>Kevin has several years of experience teaching &amp; mentoring early career professionals as they transition to technology from non-STEM disciplines.

            // Select all <details> elements
            const detailsTags = document.querySelectorAll("details");

            // Loop through each <details> and set the 'open' attribute
            detailsTags.forEach((detail) => {
                detail.setAttribute("open", "");
            });
