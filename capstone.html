        <b>ü§î Problem Space</b>
        <p class="tldr">Homelessness is a serious issue in Seattle, so much so that it has gotten
        national attention. It's also highly contentious; everyone everywhere has an opinion about it,
      and how the government is (or isn't; or could; or should) be handling things.</p>

        <p>The City of Seattle Human Services Department (HSD) contracts
          with community organizations to provide housing & health services to
          people experiencing homelessness.</p>

          <p class="tldr">Before this project, HSD staff pieced together
          program & contract data from many sources. This is a time-consuming and frustrating
          process, but this information is critical for informing policy and highly visible
          through media outreach.</p>

          <p>The city needed a system to capture institutional knowledge, automate data ingest,
            and makes data analysis more streamlined and trustworthy. My team, the Rolling Capstones,
            sought to provide this solution to the City.</p>
            <p class="tldr"> We partnered with <b>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</b> and <b>Tableau</b> for this work.
          The partners offered us strategic guidance and access to tools.</p>
          <p>I was <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/news/2019/05/msim-students-help-seattle-better-serve-homeless-people">interviewed</a> about this project,
            won <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/news/2019/06/capstone-puts-students-skills-display">Best in Class</a> on project presentation night,
            and got a thank you note from the Mayor herself. My colleague <a href="https://www.tkku.me/#/city-of-seattle/">Tiffany Ku</a> documented her perspective on the project as well.</p>

        <b>üìù Initial Planning</b>
        <p>This project was around six months of work, with approximately
          one month of up-front planning and five months of execution. We initially
          scoped it across four phases.</p>
            <img class="figure" src="./img/capstone-1.png">
        <p class="tldr">When we added more detail, it became evident that each of these phases
          would not have the same amount of time devoted to it, and that they might run concurrently.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section writing" id="writing">
          <b>üé® Design</b>
          <p>To learn about the problem space, we interviewed several domain experts.
            We analyzed the major themes that emerged from our interviews and used the
            insights to inform the way we display information and our approach to the project.</p>

            <p class="tldr">It was important for us to involve
            different stakeholders in our design process. AWS hosted a working backwards
            workshop to help flesh out user requirements.</p>

            <p class="tldr">Tableau collaborated with us on the design strategy for the reporting dashboards by providing guidance and
            training. We went through several iterations of data warehouse development
            before producing the final SSIS package ready for production. Most
            importantly, we tested and sought feedback at every stage of the process
            to make sure we were understanding things correctly.</p>

          <div class="section writing" id="writing">
            <b>üí™ Work</b>
            <p>We took the existing system for reporting (a Tableau dashboard) and
              shifted much of the logic that lived in calculated fields into the
              database itself. That way, users have to worry less about the
              validation of data, and can try out more interesting analyses.</p>

              <p class="tldr">Here's an example of what the dashboard looks like,
                with dummy data:</p>
                <img class="figure tldr" src="./img/capstone-3.png">
            <p class="tldr">Our ETL pipeline consisted of a series of scripts written in Microsoft SQL Server.
              A job on the server watches a folder to see if new files need to be uploaded
              to the database. After ingest, the data is validated for proper typing and then
              brought from staging into production.</p>

            </div>
              <div class="section writing" id="writing">
                <b>üï∞ Future Work</b>
                <p class="tldr">Our hope is that our solution can help HSD tell a more complete
                  story about how the City is serving its most vulnerable populations. Part of
                  this work means taking a look at the current state of things at the city in
                  addition to our technical tools.</p>

                <p>Throughout our project, we audited business processes to better understand
                  where later improvements could be made. Broadly, these consist of improvements
                  for personnel training/job duties and technical architecture. We hope the City takes
                some of these ideas into consideration when they start to build out version 2.0 of our system.</p>
