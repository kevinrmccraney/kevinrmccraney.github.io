There are a couple of different things which enable this:

1. Hosting the site on someone else's computer (Microsoft/GitHub)

3. A custom markdown parser that I wrote

## && Why write a custom parser for your blog? &&

One of my central theses is that as the internet becomes more of a dark forest and there is consolidation of platforms, it is important to understand and control something which resembles the means of production. There are so many layers of abstraction that knowing how everything works perfectly is a quixotic undertaking (reality has a surprising amount of detail), but being able to think through exactly what you need and deliver on it makes you a better thinker.

I like to think of this as a mediocre woodworker building a mediocre chair. Being the best doesn't matter; looking at the world differently does. This proverbial person may not be the best craftsperson, but the skills they gain from trying to create order from chaos (or wood, as the case may be) is more important than the final project is.

Or, as they say at Daptone Records, shitty is pretty.

## ü§î Problem Space
I participated in a video contest for the iConference, a global consortium of information schools. The goal was to make a promotional video explaining the relevance of iSchools. I won second place. My project was the only entry produced by an individual.

The prize was a lump sum of cash and an expenses-paid trip to the conference in Philadelphia that year. I consider attending this conference as one of the reasons I elected to pursue a Masters degree.

## üìù Process
As a challenge, I made the video exclusively using three pieces of software: Keynote, iMovie, and Ableton Live. I made simple keyframe animations using Keynote and then cut them together in iMovie.

![Example image mood board for project](./img/ischool-1.png "Example image mood board for project")

I was inspired by a video about AI from the philosophy of Nick Bostrom, [a video by Radiolab about symmetry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEQskIsHKT8), and a [video about the explanation of relativity by a young physicist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLcFAI5SZg). I also collected a series of simple animated GIFs whose aesthetics I found simple, yet compelling.

![Example ableton image](./img/ischool-2.png "Example Ableton image")

I also made the background music to accompany and score the video using an analog synthesizer I had at the time.

I initially wrote the music and did sound design for the video in Ableton Live and recorded the voiceovers and other cues alongside the video using my synth.

It took me about two weeks (from conceptualization to finalized script) to complete this video. I did it during evenings and a couple of weekends while working full-time.

## ü§î What is a colophon?
A colophon is essentially a statement containing the information about the publication of a text.

I used to see blogs that shared this information, but never knew what it meant--they usually documented their choice of typography and other stuff, which seemed weird and irrelevant to me. We're in the age of hypertext and the process behind writing has changed significantly, so why refer back to old forms?

To reimagine what a colophon does, I'll cite all of the sites that inspired the design of this one. The more influential sites are stacked toward the top.

If you're on this list and happen to see this page, I'd love to talk to you.

## ü§î Problem Space
During my time in graduate school, I participated in a multi-quarter research project focused on design for the Anthropocene.

The research project was structured as a reading group. In the first half of the project, we would read an excerpt from a large text or a handful of papers on a theme, and then come together and talk through our takeaways.

## üõ† Process
Initially, I was curious about two overarching questions: is data, as an encoded artifact, materialized ideology; and has anyone ever calculated the energy consumption of performing basic office tasks?

When the research project was running, it was my duty to introduce these ideas to other folks by leading a discussion section focused on these topics.

## üéâ Outcomes
The outcome of the project was an undergraduate curriculum focused on some of the different emergent themes of the group--situated design, adaptation to the environment, energy consumption, supply chains, and repair.

I concluded my participation in the group by writing a module on power consumption for the syllabus we produced. You can view [our published curriculum here](https://doi.org/10.24242/jclis.v3i1.137).

## ü§î Problem Space
During the second year of my masters, I had a class focused on design inquiry and rapid prototyping. Broadly theme was on citizen science.My partner Drew and I sought to answer the following question: **how might we involve citizen scientists in the aggregation and annotation of data about apple trees?**

In the homebrewing scene, the Pacific Northwest is famed for both its hops and its apple cultivars. Out here, beer may be locally-sourced, but cider's supply chain is long--the PNW imports many of the fruits it uses to make cider from other countries.

**Cidermakers (and researchers)** are interested in identifying old growth orchards and apple trees to impart new flavors into their brews. They look for quintessentially American *terroir*, but don't necessarily have time to hunt down particular fruiting trees themselves.

Separately, **hobbyist naturalists** might be interested in the cultivation and maintenance of trees in the field. They probably care about trees, but are not expert enough to identify particular varieties themselves.

## üìù Initial Research
We started the project by exploring the design space through literature review and interviews. We wanted to observe tree-related work being done *in situ*, to contextualize some of the things experts think about when identifying fruits.

Our strategy to narrow down our design space involved both contextual inquiry (to better understand the practical work that goes into working with fruit) and traditional interviews (to understand the theoretical models and terminology experts employ).

We initially thought that we would want to teach people how to identify fruit in the field, letting researchers know that a particular tree was worth making the trip out to see. We decided to tag along with some researchers while they did some field work.

## ‚úã Intervention
Coordinating people to take care of orchards is a pain point that stakeholders frequently feel. It is difficult for arborists to teach people to prune correctly and harder still to prevent over-pruning of trees, especially if the orchard is not privately owned or commercially operated.

We found that cider-makers and aligned researchers can benefit from a system that enables a broader, distributed workforce assisting their efforts in the field. They need a way to **share knowledge** about trees.

From our literature review, we found that there is not an all-in-one tool that assists people in the classification of trees or fruits. Existing solutions are highly detailed/precise, often use technical or scientific language that might not be familiar to people without domain expertise, and are not mobile-friendly. This is an issue for us--the apple aficionado with limited domain expertise is left out.

Realizing this as a pain point, our goal was to harness the power of citizen scientists to to geolocate, photograph and measure, and definitively identify apple trees using a mobile interface. This would allow non-subject-matter experts to become conversent and share knowledge. We created a **paper prototype** to test the logic and user flow of our classification to see if users could correctly identify attributes in the field.

We also created a demo data repository with five types of apples in it, entered their possible identification attributes, and developed a logical flow to classify an example apple in five steps or less.

![an image of our paper prototype interface design](./img/apple-2.png "paper prototype")

## üé® Design & Refine
The goal for our first prototype was to help people unfamiliar with trees or fruits sufficiently classify them. We created a robust testing methodology and procedure, trying our our prototype over 6 individuals with varying degrees of knowledge about apples. We collected both qualitative and quantitative feedback. After completing user testing, we also asked our users to help us make our design better.

We found we can accurately predict apples a little bit better than chance, which was worse than expected. Unfortunately, we did not have a very discriminating classifier (the most important metric for us, since we want to minimize incorrect classifications in order to support better data for researchers).

Follow-up interviews with experts suggested that documenting information about trees that would be simultaneously useful for researchers but salient by the average person is a thorny problem.

Moreover, they let us know that longitudinal analysis of trees is something that is hard to come by, but also contributes significantly to the knowledge a researcher might have about fruit quality or viability.

So we decided to pivot, reconceptualizing our design.

The goal for our second prototype was to turn the process of documenting trees into an AR game. In order to test the efficacy of this system, we created a prototype of a mobile user-interface in Balsamiq that a user can navigate through in order to record specific attributes of a tree, as well as other specific tasks related to documentation.

We attempted to create a user interface that made adding information about trees fun for users. We performed more user testing, to see if a user could sufficiently navigate a mobile interface when prompted with a task in natural language, or describe their interaction with the prototype using a "talk aloud" or "think aloud" process.

![an image of our revised prototype interface design](./img/apple-3.png "revised paper prototype")

We found that users really enjoyed the process of documenting trees but had trouble understanding a few things: namely, transitioning between the augmented reality's first-person view and the bird's eye view of the map.

## üï∞ Future Work
Enabling researchers to understand individual trees and orchards over time is an important part of the project we didn't get to address. We would like to change the design of our UI to help people to better understand and encourage the collection of longitudinal data.

In subsequent iterations, we hope to address data quality and privacy issues in our project. One of our users was concerned with her location being accessible to other people when she used the application. We conceptually changed the way data is aggregated on the backend to address her concern.

If we were to return to this project several years out, with the advances in computer vision that have happened, we would be at the stage that we could build an actual prototype app and start working with users to see if capturing data is as effective in the field as we hypothesized it would be.

## ü§î Problem Space
During the second year of my masters, I had a class focused on design inquiry and rapid prototyping. Broadly theme was on citizen science.My partner Drew and I sought to answer the following question: **how might we involve citizen scientists in the aggregation and annotation of data about apple trees?**

In the homebrewing scene, the Pacific Northwest is famed for both its hops and its apple cultivars. Out here, beer may be locally-sourced, but cider's supply chain is long--the PNW imports many of the fruits it uses to make cider from other countries.

**Cidermakers (and researchers)** are interested in identifying old growth orchards and apple trees to impart new flavors into their brews. They look for quintessentially American *terroir*, but don't necessarily have time to hunt down particular fruiting trees themselves.

Separately, **hobbyist naturalists** might be interested in the cultivation and maintenance of trees in the field. They probably care about trees, but are not expert enough to identify particular varieties themselves.

&& Outside of my normal 9-to-5 job, I also teach a class at my alma mater of the University of Washington. My class tends towards people who are early or mid career and are attempting to either pivot into the field of data science, or become more skilled/literate with data analysis and use that to level up there already extant subject-matter expertise. && 

Having taught in the UW iSchool for a few years, I often get similar questions from my students in the classroom. I've captured some of those questions below and expanded on them more than I normally do in class.

### üíº What do you look for when hiring? What do you recommend for building your first data portfolio pieces? 
I have mostly done hiring at smaller organizations, so it tends to be higher-touch experience than at a large tech company, and you can use that to your advantage. In scenarios like this, if you can craft your portfolio examples tailored specifically for the role you're applying to, it really goes a long way. 

&& For example, when trying to get into my first job, out of grad school I did a very niche environmental science data visualization for folks and that demonstrated that--while I didn't have deep expertise in the domain--I could quickly become conversant in new ideas that I would be introduced to.&&

In general, there are a handful of core things I look for in someone's portfolio when hiring:

1. **End-to-end work demonstrating skills across data science roles.** 
&&An example of this is going from research question/business case -> implementation in code/infra -> analytical work -> output summary, which may or may not include visualization.&&

2. **A project/domain of interest or curiosity that hasn't been overdone.** 
&&This shows you're a creative thinker and can approach problems from different vantage points, plus the subject matter is a differentiator unto itself. For example, instead of doing the typical Titanic random forest or iris k-means, do a data analysis project with the Great British Bake-Off or RuPaul's Drag Race.&&

3. **Different levels of information accessibility to show communication and collaboration skills.** 
&& Maybe you summarize everything into a nice blog post and walk through your analytical process, but then you share your source on GitHub in a well-documented manner. &&

The best candidates have at least 2 examples like this on their personal site, but possibly more. &&Typically I weight an ongoing programming or data analysis project higher than I would a one-off, because it demonstrates consistent engagement with an idea over time, but I don't discount anybody for having tons of small projects. &&

### üîé How do you recommend tailoring your job search for the first time, especially coming from a discipline that is not focused on technology?

1. **Be kind to yourself.** - You‚Äôre trying to switch careers into a new domain and also learn the technical aspects of the domain *and* also learn the new professional communication tactics, rhythms, and customs. Each of these things separately could be a full time job. &&It will absolutely take time to get you there. It‚Äôs really helpful to have conversations with other people who are doing similar work, support each other, and keep in touch about learning and growing. This honest, engaged human connection on the job search is powerful and like rocket fuel in some situations, and is what real networking is.&&
2. **Job hunting is like writing--just sit in the chair and do it.** &&Block off a fixed window of time every day to look for jobs.&& Use affinity organizations (communities based around software you use in this domain, professional groups, etc. ), LinkedIn, and job boards to find jobs. &&Apply on the company website if possible, rather than through an aggregator. Save those jobs in some form (text doc or spreadsheet on your computer is okay), review them, and apply.&& If applying via Linkedin, bias toward companies where you have a 2nd or 3rd degree contact, and try to connect with them and ask for a referral. &&If you can make friends with a trustworthy recruiter, interview them for what they‚Äôre looking for. Use the context across all of these to find more jobs.&& Set some goal for yourself‚Äîpersonally, I keep going until I find five jobs I‚Äôm confident about (>60%  responsibility, duties, or skill match) and apply to each of them. 
3. **Learn to notice.** Part of the work you have to do right now is understanding how filtering works to determine good jobs for you vs. bad ones. &&At this point, avoid the term ‚Äúsenior‚Äù and optimize for ‚Äújunior‚Äù or jobs without a qualification at the beginning (senior may have management duties and would be less focused on technical expertise, but would still require domain knowledge, so you probably wouldn‚Äôt be well-suited).&& Read the descriptions closely and understand what what the firm is looking for as best you can‚Äîkeep track of words and noun phrases that reoccur and try to do research into them if they‚Äôre unfamiliar. 
4. **Build in reps as fast as you can.** Try to get your first conversation with a hiring manager or recruiter as early in this process as possible. Ask for feedback when you can (some orgs like Amazon don‚Äôt give feedback). &&Some recruiters, being time poor, will end a conversation with you early if you‚Äôre not a good fit and tell you why, which is definitely to your advantage as rejections go. All the information you can gather here is a scientific experiment‚Äîwhat are the different things you can say to represent yourself or convey your experience to get a step further through the job-seeking process? Build in psychological distance so you can stay true to point 1!&& Half the battle is positioning; the other half is doing the work. You will fail, but you want to fail fast and fail often so you can learn faster & reposition.
5. **Augment your supplemental materials.** While they won‚Äôt explicitly get you a job, a portfolio, reel, or showcase of your work is invaluable if you‚Äôre going to attempt to transition into the space from a field you don‚Äôt have professional experience in. &&If you can do an end-to-end project which captures use of your skills in some way, that will both level you up re: domain knowledge (for example, something my peers in school did was salad taxonomy -> ML classifier; based on salad metadata, assign category -> explanation of results) but also act as an artifact that supports your candidacy. It‚Äôll give you something to talk about.&&

## üìï How do I find the best resources to continue learning or professional development outside the classroom?
When I worked at the University of North Carolina helping faculty members with course design, one professor did something I liked a lot. She presented the fundamental elements of each unit to students as required readings, and then paired them with a section called "If You Want to Know More". In this section, there were materials designed to augment the narrative threads that often came up in class or in the other reading materials.

#### Programming, Computational Thinking, and Systems Thinking
Across the board I highly recommend books by [Allen B. Downey](https://greenteapress.com/wp/). His materials were a major force multiplier in my ability to learn and understand programming, after coming from a non-STEM background.
&&
 
 - [How to Teach Computational Thinking by Stephen Wolfram (Blog Post)](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2016/09/how-to-teach-computational-thinking/)

 - [Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions - Brian Christian](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365)
&&
#### Data Visualization, Narrative, and Communication
There's no avoiding the work of the greatest. Anything by Tufte is a great primer on visualization, but I think it's best to start at the start with [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward R.Tufte](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/).

<span class="tldr"> For example, when trying to get into my first job, out of grad school I did a very niche environmental science data visualization for folks and that demonstrated that--while I didn't have deep expertise in the domain--I could quickly become conversant in new ideas that I would be introduced to.</span>

In general, there are a handful of core things I look for in someone's portfolio when hiring:

1. **End-to-end work demonstrating skills across data science roles.** 
<span class="tldr">An example of this is going from research question/business case -> implementation in code/infra -> analytical work -> output summary, which may or may not include visualization.</span>

2. **A project/domain of interest or curiosity that hasn't been overdone.** 
<span class="tldr">This shows you're a creative thinker and can approach problems from different vantage points, plus the subject matter is a differentiator unto itself. For example, instead of doing the typical Titanic random forest or iris k-means, do a data analysis project with the Great British Bake-Off or RuPaul's Drag Race.</span>

3. **Different levels of information accessibility to show communication and collaboration skills.** 
<span class="tldr"> Maybe you summarize everything into a nice blog post and walk through your analytical process, but then you share your source on GitHub in a well-documented manner. </span>

The best candidates have at least 2 examples like this on their personal site, but possibly more. <span class="tldr">Typically I weight an ongoing programming or data analysis project higher than I would a one-off, because it demonstrates consistent engagement with an idea over time, but I don't discount anybody for having tons of small projects. </span>

### üîé How do you recommend tailoring your job search for the first time, especially coming from a discipline that is not focused on technology?

1. **Be kind to yourself.** - You‚Äôre trying to switch careers into a new domain and also learn the technical aspects of the domain *and* also learn the new professional communication tactics, rhythms, and customs. Each of these things separately could be a full time job. <span class="tldr">It will absolutely take time to get you there. It‚Äôs really helpful to have conversations with other people who are doing similar work, support each other, and keep in touch about learning and growing. This honest, engaged human connection on the job search is powerful and like rocket fuel in some situations, and is what real networking is.</span>
2. **Job hunting is like writing--just sit in the chair and do it.** <span class="tldr">Block off a fixed window of time every day to look for jobs.</span> Use affinity organizations (communities based around software you use in this domain, professional groups, etc. ), LinkedIn, and job boards to find jobs. <span class="tldr">Apply on the company website if possible, rather than through an aggregator. Save those jobs in some form (text doc or spreadsheet on your computer is okay), review them, and apply.</span> If applying via Linkedin, bias toward companies where you have a 2nd or 3rd degree contact, and try to connect with them and ask for a referral. <span class="tldr">If you can make friends with a trustworthy recruiter, interview them for what they‚Äôre looking for. Use the context across all of these to find more jobs.</span> Set some goal for yourself‚Äîpersonally, I keep going until I find five jobs I‚Äôm confident about (>60%  responsibility, duties, or skill match) and apply to each of them. 
3. **Learn to notice.** Part of the work you have to do right now is understanding how filtering works to determine good jobs for you vs. bad ones. <span class="tldr">At this point, avoid the term ‚Äúsenior‚Äù and optimize for ‚Äújunior‚Äù or jobs without a qualification at the beginning (senior may have management duties and would be less focused on technical expertise, but would still require domain knowledge, so you probably wouldn‚Äôt be well-suited).</span> Read the descriptions closely and understand what what the firm is looking for as best you can‚Äîkeep track of words and noun phrases that reoccur and try to do research into them if they‚Äôre unfamiliar. 
4. **Build in reps as fast as you can.** Try to get your first conversation with a hiring manager or recruiter as early in this process as possible. Ask for feedback when you can (some orgs like Amazon don‚Äôt give feedback). <span class="tldr">Some recruiters, being time poor, will end a conversation with you early if you‚Äôre not a good fit and tell you why, which is definitely to your advantage as rejections go. All the information you can gather here is a scientific experiment‚Äîwhat are the different things you can say to represent yourself or convey your experience to get a step further through the job-seeking process? Build in psychological distance so you can stay true to point 1!</span> Half the battle is positioning; the other half is doing the work. You will fail, but you want to fail fast and fail often so you can learn faster & reposition.
5. **Augment your supplemental materials.** While they won‚Äôt explicitly get you a job, a portfolio, reel, or showcase of your work is invaluable if you‚Äôre going to attempt to transition into the space from a field you don‚Äôt have professional experience in. <span class="tldr">If you can do an end-to-end project which captures use of your skills in some way, that will both level you up re: domain knowledge (for example, something my peers in school did was salad taxonomy -> ML classifier; based on salad metadata, assign category -> explanation of results) but also act as an artifact that supports your candidacy. It‚Äôll give you something to talk about.</span>

## üìï How do I find the best resources to continue learning or professional development outside the classroom?
When I worked at the University of North Carolina helping faculty members with course design, one professor did something I liked a lot. She presented the fundamental elements of each unit to students as required readings, and then paired them with a section called "If You Want to Know More". In this section, there were materials designed to augment the narrative threads that often came up in class or in the other reading materials.

#### Programming, Computational Thinking, and Systems Thinking
Across the board I highly recommend books by [Allen B. Downey](https://greenteapress.com/wp/). His materials were a major force multiplier in my ability to learn and understand programming, after coming from a non-STEM background.

## ü§î Problem Space
When I was browsing the web relatively recently, I found [Shantini Vyas's website](https://www.shantini.co/posts/how-i-got-into-tech/), which talks about how she ended up in her current career working for Apple.

Many of my students and mentees at the University of Washington ask what it's like to transition from an explicitly non-tech career to being a programmer or data scientist full time, so I figured I would put something similar together.

## üõ† Process
#### 2007-2011
Studied at The Ohio State University; lived as a freegan for most of this time, and sold thrifted things online. Studied computer music under Mark Ainger, which was maybe my first exposure to serious programming in Max/MSP/Jitter.

#### 2012
Worked as librarian/professional tutor; volunteered for ESL teaching; started exploring generative code and design using Processing

#### 2013
Taught English in China; began self-study in data science and programming

#### 2014
Returned from China; worked as professional tutor; continued self-study in data science and programming

#### 2015-2017
Worked at UNC in the business school producing coursework; did some simple web programming & maintenance/data analysis as part of job

#### June 2017
Quit job; moved to Seattle

#### September 2017
Enrolled in graduate school; Masters of Science in Information Management. Won a graduate fellowship to work in the Foreign Service through the Foreign Affairs Information Technology program but declined it to try my hand at the tech industry and stay in one place for a while

#### Summer 2018
[Open Data Literacy Internship](./odl.html) with City of Seattle and State of Washington, where I generated embeddings and modeled topics in public records

#### Autumn 2018 - Spring 2019
Data Modeling & User Research for [IAC Data Model Project](./capstone.html); I probably talk about this project the most in interviews

#### Spring 2019
Graduated from MSIM; applied to (likely) thousands of jobs on the internet, trying to decide between a career in quantitative user experience research and data science straight-up; got offered some insultingly low salaries as a data analyst as part of this journey (<$30k in downtown Seattle)

#### September 2019 - October 2022
Data Engineer at Four Peaks Environmental Science and Data Solutions, where I did all kinds of stuff and learned rapidly about technical work but also having a customer-focused mindset

#### October 2022 - Present
Data Engineer at Bold Penguin, where I maintained data pipelines for systems that process PDFs with computer vision, ingest data into a database, etc.

## üéâ Outcomes
I still run into questions I'm not sure how to answer professionally, and put in lots of effort to self-study and learn new things.

#### 2012
Worked as librarian/professional tutor; volunteered for ESL teaching; started exploring generative code and design using Processing

#### 2013
Taught English in China; began self-study in data science and programming

#### 2014
Returned from China; worked as professional tutor; continued self-study in data science and programming

#### 2015-2017
Worked at UNC in the business school producing coursework; did some simple web programming & maintenance/data analysis as part of job

#### June 2017
Quit job; moved to Seattle

#### September 2017
Enrolled in graduate school; Masters of Science in Information Management. Won a graduate fellowship to work in the Foreign Service through the Foreign Affairs Information Technology program but declined it to try my hand at the tech industry and stay in one place for a while

#### Summer 2018
[Open Data Literacy Internship](./odl.html) with City of Seattle and State of Washington, where I generated embeddings and modeled topics in public records

#### Autumn 2018 - Spring 2019
Data Modeling & User Research for [IAC Data Model Project](./capstone.html); I probably talk about this project the most in interviews

#### Spring 2019
Graduated from MSIM; applied to (likely) thousands of jobs on the internet, trying to decide between a career in quantitative user experience research and data science straight-up; got offered some insultingly low salaries as a data analyst as part of this journey (<$30k in downtown Seattle)

#### September 2019 - October 2022
Data Engineer at Four Peaks Environmental Science and Data Solutions, where I did all kinds of stuff and learned rapidly about technical work but also having a customer-focused mindset

#### October 2022 - Present
Data Engineer at Bold Penguin, where I maintained data pipelines for systems that process PDFs with computer vision, ingest data into a database, etc.

## üéâ Outcomes
I still run into questions I'm not sure how to answer professionally, and put in lots of effort to self-study and learn new things.

## ü§î Problem Space
For our final project in Data Science I, my partners and I analyzed a database of cinemetrics (data about shot length, shot frequency, and so on) in order to understand how political trends influenced Russian cinema during a particular period.

We wanted to evaluate whether there was a statistically significant and observable change in films after Stalin mandated Soviet realism, and then another change after he died.

## üõ† Process
We scraped a website that collects metrics about foreign films, de-duplciated entries, and then performed a time-series analysis with ANCOVA.

## üéâ Outcomes
We delivered our findings to our data science class. Ours was the only project that focused on the digital humanities, so we had to introduce some key concepts related to humanistic inquiry and film studies to the class during the presentation.

## ü§î Problem Space
The Protek Audioino was a very open-ended project to create an interactive physical computing system. We had a lot of freedom to experiment and try different things. The only constraints were to incorporate the following requirements:
- **Hardware** - Must use an Arduino and any combination of sensors, actuators, circuits, etc.
- **Software** - The code for the hardware prototype has to be interactive.
- **Physical** - Must have an enclosure for the electronics that serves to communicate the purpose and goals of the prototype.

My teammates and I built a photocell theremin and reactive light device for our physical computing course. We called it the Protek Audioino, after our initials rearranged (**Proshonjit**, **Tiffany**, and **Kevin**).

 ![Example signal flow](./img/synth-1.png "Example signal flow")
        
This is a model of how all the parts of the system interact.

The device we built provides an exciting experience for musical performance. Our prototype combines electronic sensors with sound and a visual component. The central hub or server of our system is a granular synthesizer. Manipulating the knobs on the synthesizer alters the tone and pitch of the sound being created. Additionally, we have included an accompanying visual display using an LED strip. The visual display responds with light patterns according to the sound from the synthesizer via a microphone sensor.

The granular synthesizer or ‚Äúcontroller‚Äù in our system uses pulse with modulation to convert a series of numbers into sound, which we have amplified with a speaker. The potentiometer controls some of the different oscillators such as timbre and tone. The photocell resistor is the pitch controller. The pitch changes based on the amount of light the photocell resistor receives.

For our visual display, we are using a microphone amp sensor to capture the sound from the synthesizer and trigger different light patterns to appear on the LED strip. We also added a potentiometer to control the light sensitivity of the LED strip.
          
## ‚úã Initial Intervention
We intended to incorporate wearable gloves and gyroscopes in our system. Gyroscope sensors were attached to the gloves along with xBees for wireless communication to and from the granular synthesizer. User movement from the gloves would control the synthesizer, and trigger the lights in turn, as if the performer was conducting in front of an orchestra.

We made the light component of the system first, because it required the least user interaction.

![Example circuit diagram](./img/synth-2.png "Circuit diagram 1")
          
## üé® Design & Refine
We had to refine our scope several times. Initially, we intended to incorporate wearable gloves in our system. Gyroscope sensors were attached to the gloves along with xBees for wireless communication to and from the granular synthesizer. User movement from the gloves would control the synthesizer, and trigger the lights in turn, as if the performer was conducting in front of an orchestra.

While we were able to get the wearable component working, we didn‚Äôt anticipate the difficulty in mapping the raw data from the gyroscope output and converting those numbers into a usable range to trigger notes on the synthesizer.

We also experience pulse width modulation interference between the XBee sensors and gyroscopes that we used.

After many problems, (including a gyroscope overheating and catching fire üë®‚ÄçüöíüßØüî•) we decided to use potentiometers and a photocell resistor for the synth. Adding a photocell resistor provided a similar experience to what we were trying to prototype with the gyroscope sensors.

![Circuit Diagram 2](./img/synth-3.png "Example circuit diagram 2")
This is the circuit we built for the synthesizer itself.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process Photos
Proshonjit and I spent a lot of time in the lab debugging and soldering. Tiffany's not pictured (she's taking the photos!) but worked just as hard.
![Working on prototype](./img/synth-4.png "Working on the prototype")

![Example working prototype](./img/synth-5.png "Example working prototype")

This is the first prototype for the wearable glove. While we had it working (briefly), eventually a gyroscope overheated and burned itself out.
![Adding a new enclosure](./img/synth-6.png "Adding a new enclosure")
              
We put our project into two different enclosures...
![Testing in the home studio](./img/synth-7.png "Testing in the home studio")            
...and tested it in my home studio!
            
## üï∞ Future Work                
If we had more time (and money for parts), we would have worked out the wearable and wireless components.

<h2>ü§î Problem Space</h2>
<p>The Protek Audioino was a very open-ended project to create an interactive physical computing system. We had a lot of freedom to experiment and try different things. The only constraints were to incorporate the following requirements:
- <strong>Hardware</strong> - Must use an Arduino and any combination of sensors, actuators, circuits, etc.
- <strong>Software</strong> - The code for the hardware prototype has to be interactive.
- <strong>Physical</strong> - Must have an enclosure for the electronics that serves to communicate the purpose and goals of the prototype.</p>
<p>My teammates and I built a photocell theremin and reactive light device for our physical computing course. We called it the Protek Audioino, after our initials rearranged (<strong>Proshonjit</strong>, <strong>Tiffany</strong>, and <strong>Kevin</strong>).</p>
<p><img alt="Example signal flow" src="./img/synth-1.png" title="Example signal flow" /></p>
<p>This is a model of how all the parts of the system interact.</p>
<p>The device we built provides an exciting experience for musical performance. Our prototype combines electronic sensors with sound and a visual component. The central hub or server of our system is a granular synthesizer. Manipulating the knobs on the synthesizer alters the tone and pitch of the sound being created. Additionally, we have included an accompanying visual display using an LED strip. The visual display responds with light patterns according to the sound from the synthesizer via a microphone sensor.</p>
<p>The granular synthesizer or ‚Äúcontroller‚Äù in our system uses pulse with modulation to convert a series of numbers into sound, which we have amplified with a speaker. The potentiometer controls some of the different oscillators such as timbre and tone. The photocell resistor is the pitch controller. The pitch changes based on the amount of light the photocell resistor receives.</p>
<p>For our visual display, we are using a microphone amp sensor to capture the sound from the synthesizer and trigger different light patterns to appear on the LED strip. We also added a potentiometer to control the light sensitivity of the LED strip.</p>
<h2>‚úã Initial Intervention</h2>
<p>We intended to incorporate wearable gloves and gyroscopes in our system. Gyroscope sensors were attached to the gloves along with xBees for wireless communication to and from the granular synthesizer. User movement from the gloves would control the synthesizer, and trigger the lights in turn, as if the performer was conducting in front of an orchestra.</p>
<p>We made the light component of the system first, because it required the least user interaction.</p>
<p><img alt="Example circuit diagram" src="./img/synth-2.png" title="Circuit diagram 1" /></p>
<h2>üé® Design &amp; Refine</h2>
<p>We had to refine our scope several times. Initially, we intended to incorporate wearable gloves in our system. Gyroscope sensors were attached to the gloves along with xBees for wireless communication to and from the granular synthesizer. User movement from the gloves would control the synthesizer, and trigger the lights in turn, as if the performer was conducting in front of an orchestra.</p>

## ü§î Problem Space
Homelessness is a serious issue in Seattle, so much so that it has gotten national attention. It's also highly contentious; everyone everywhere has an opinion about it, and how the government is (or isn't; or could; or should) be handling things.

The City of Seattle Human Services Department (HSD) contracts with community organizations to provide housing & health services to people experiencing homelessness. This program & contract data describes the resources each organization gets and the populations it serves.

Before this project, Human Services staff pieced together program & contract data from many sources. This is a time-consuming and frustrating process, but this information is critical for informing policy and highly visible through media outreach. The City needed a system to capture institutional knowledge, automate data ingest, and makes data analysis more streamlined and trustworthy. My team, the Rolling Capstones, sought to provide this solution to the City. We partnered with **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and **Tableau** for this work. The partners offered us strategic guidance and access to tools, but we did the work ourselves.

## üìù Initial Planning
        
This project was around six months of work, with approximately one month of up-front planning and five months of execution. We initially scoped it across four phases.

![Project timeline](./img/capstone-1.png "The project timeline")

When we added more detail, it became evident that each of these phases would not have the same amount of time devoted to it, and that they might run concurrently.

![Project plan](./img/capstone-2.png "The project plan")

## üé® Design
          
To learn about the problem space, we interviewed several domain experts. We analyzed the major themes that emerged from our interviews and used the insights to inform the way we display information and our approach to the project.

It was important for us to involve different stakeholders in our design process. AWS hosted a "Working Backwards" workshop to help flesh out user requirements. Working Backwards is their outcome-focused method for product development, and thinking of the solution we would build for City staff with the outcome in mind was a great exercise in level-setting for the project.

Tableau collaborated with us on the design strategy for the reporting dashboards by providing guidance and training. We went through several iterations of data warehouse development before producing the final SSIS package ready for production. Most importantly, we tested and sought feedback at every stage of the process to make sure we were understanding things correctly.

## üí™ Work
We knew we had to build some means to clean, structure, and ingest data. Our ETL pipeline consisted of a series of scripts written in Microsoft SQL Server. A job on the server watches a folder to see if new files need to be uploaded to the database. After ingest, the data is validated for proper typing and then brought from staging into production.

We took the existing system for reporting (a Tableau dashboard) and shifted much of the logic that lived in calculated fields into the database itself. That way, users have to worry less about the validation of data, and can try out more interesting analyses.

Here's an example of what the dashboard looks like, populated with dummy data:

![Example dashboard](./img/capstone-3.png "Example dashboard")

## üï∞ Future Work & Outcomes
Our hope is that our solution can help HSD tell a more complete story about how the City is serving its most vulnerable populations. Part of this work means taking a look at the current state of things at the city in addition to our technical tools.

Throughout our project, we audited business processes to better understand where later improvements could be made. Broadly, these consist of improvements for personnel training/job duties and technical architecture. We hope the City takes some of these ideas into consideration when they start to build out version 2.0 of our system.

I was [interviewed](https://ischool.uw.edu/news/2019/05/msim-students-help-seattle-better-serve-homeless-people) about this project, [won Best in Class](https://ischool.uw.edu/news/2019/06/capstone-puts-students-skills-display) on project presentation night, and got a thank you note from the Mayor herself. My colleague [Tiffany Ku](https://www.tkku.me/#/city-of-seattle/) documented her perspective on the project as well.

## ü§î Problem Space
For eight weeks in summer 2018, I worked for the City of Seattle and the State of Washington on an open data-related project. The scope of the internship was to support data literacy for people in the public sector.

My partner and I collaborated on creating a governance document for an open data-related paraprofessional organization. In parallel, I spent time analyzing trends in public records requests to support proactive disclosure of datasets.

The project had two parts: data analysis and a policy document. I was in charge of the data analysis.

## üõ† Process
We began by interviewing a number of different records professionals. We collected their names through the snowball sampling method. We spoke with interview subjects for about an hour each, then performed thematic analysis based on our notes and
coded transcripts, which you can view [in this repo](https://github.com/OpenDataLiteracy/OpenDataAlliance-KM/tree/master/thematic-clustering-sessions). We sought to better understand the needs and expectations of data professionals that might be involved in the organization.

Once we identified the themes, my partner and I collaboratively drafted a document that acted as a charter for the organization, outlining the expectations for participants. 

The end-goal was for Open Data Champions (people that work with open data) to use some kind of online tool or platform as a teaching tool to analyze their own data within their organization. This practice would foster conversations about how to use and develop novel open data projects, bootstrapping interest across their organization.

As a first attempt at meeting this goal, I began with three datasets from different municipalities across Western Washington. I researched current techniques in natural language processing and clustering algorithms, building a data processing pipeline and visualization toolkit.

## üéâ Outcomes
We traveled to Olympia to meet with some of the partners who helped facilitate the internship. We also presented our work for discussion, which you can see online.

## ü§î Problem Space
For eight weeks in summer 2018, I worked for the City of Seattle and the State of Washington on an open data-related project. The scope of the internship was to support data literacy for people in the public sector.

My partner and I collaborated on creating a governance document for an open data-related paraprofessional organization. In parallel, I spent time analyzing trends in public records requests to support proactive disclosure of datasets.

The project had two parts: data analysis and a policy document. I was in charge of the data analysis.

## üõ† Process
We began by interviewing a number of different records professionals. We collected their names through the snowball sampling method. We spoke with interview subjects for about an hour each, then performed thematic analysis based on our notes and
coded transcripts, which you can view [in this repo](https://github.com/OpenDataLiteracy/OpenDataAlliance-KM/tree/master/thematic-clustering-sessions). We sought to better understand the needs and expectations of data professionals that might be involved in the organization.

Once we identified the themes, my partner and I collaboratively drafted a document that acted as a charter for the organization, outlining the expectations for participants. 

The end-goal was for Open Data Champions (people that work with open data) to use some kind of online tool or platform as a teaching tool to analyze their own data within their organization. This practice would foster conversations about how to use and develop novel open data projects, bootstrapping interest across their organization.

As a first attempt at meeting this goal, I began with three datasets from different municipalities across Western Washington. I researched current techniques in natural language processing and clustering algorithms, building a data processing pipeline and visualization toolkit.

## üéâ Outcomes
We traveled to Olympia to meet with some of the partners who helped facilitate the internship. We also presented our work for discussion, which you can see online.

## ü§î Problem Space

&&Information problems often seem on the surface to be exclusively technical, but in reality are deeply human-centered. Fortunately, &&I'm a data engineer with a humanistic mindset. I have experience designing full-stack applications that meet business needs and can power analytics platforms, and teaching students to position themselves and thrive in the fast-paced world of data science.

&&I want to help people design better software systems, learn how to think analytically, and provide more value for their business. My aim is to chat with you and provide you with design considerations for your information problem, whether that's hiring, software architecture design, or whatever else!&&

In addition to my experiences listed on this site, I also do consulting on one-off projects, both large-scale and small. My hourly rate is negotiable depending on the project, task, and degree of commitment. &&If you‚Äôre a student or early-career professional, please reach out. I always make time for students for free.&&

## üõ† Process
My expertise tends toward the following:

- **Data modeling and database architecture**&& - Working with stakeholders so we can best represent data within a relational or semi-structured datastore&&
- **Data pipelines design and architecture**&& - Using my preferred cloud environment AWS, building a toolkit to take data from one source, process it, and store in some form&&
- **Web application design**&& - Building a frontend that sits on top of a database and allows for data interrogation with visualizations or reporting. My expertise here is in Django/Flask.&&
- **Initial UI/UX of applications**&& - Working with stakeholders to identify the core feature set of an application, and represent it in a form which can be handed off to designers&&
- **Information architecture**&& - In case you‚Äôre trying to organize a body of information for consistency or ease of access, I have experience doing that. I also have experience crafting niche taxonomies/categorizing systems for machine learning classification projects.&&
- **Instructional design**&& - As an ESL teacher & data science professional, I have experience building curricula and producing engaging learning materials for students. I can also provide some edited lecture materials on request to demonstrate my experience teaching a class.&&
- **Career advising**&& - If you‚Äôre an early career professional and you‚Äôre looking for some engagement about how to get your first data science-related job, I can review your materials and help you position yourself; I‚Äôve successfully helped people negotiate for double-digit percentage increases in their salary during hiring or raises, and will provide contact info for reference if requested.&&
