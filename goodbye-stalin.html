        <h1>ðŸŒƒ Goodbye Stalin: Analyzing Russian Cinema</h1>
        <h2>ðŸ¤” Problem Space</h2>
<p>For our final project in Data Science I, my partners and I analyzed a database of cinemetrics (data about shot length, shot frequency, and so on) in order to understand how political trends influenced Russian cinema during a particular period.</p>
<p>We wanted to evaluate whether there was a statistically significant and observable change in films after Stalin mandated Soviet realism, and then another change after he died.</p>
<h2>ðŸ›  Process</h2>
<p>We scraped a website that collects metrics about foreign films, de-duplciated entries, and then performed a time-series analysis with ANCOVA.</p>
<h2>ðŸŽ‰ Outcomes</h2>
<p>We delivered our findings to our data science class. Ours was the only project that focused on the digital humanities, so we had to introduce some key concepts related to humanistic inquiry and film studies to the class during the presentation.</p>
