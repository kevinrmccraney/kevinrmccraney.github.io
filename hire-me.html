            <h1>ðŸ’¸ Hire Me</h1>
            <h2>ðŸ¤” Problem Space</h2>
<p><details><summary>I'm a data engineer with a humanistic mindset.</summary><br></p>
<p>I fundamentally believe that there is a deceptive nature to information problems--they often seem on the surface to be exclusively technical, but in reality are deeply human-centered. I have experience designing full-stack applications that meet business needs and can power analytics platforms. I also teach students to position themselves and thrive in the fast-paced world of data science.</details></p>
<p><details><summary>In addition to my experiences listed on this site, I also do consulting on one-off projects, both large-scale and small. My hourly rate is negotiable depending on the project, task, and degree of commitment.</summary><br></p>
<p>I want to help people design better software systems, learn how to think analytically, and provide more value for their business. My aim is to chat with you and provide you with design considerations for your information problem, whether that's hiring, software architecture design, or whatever else!</details></p>
<p><details><summary>If youâ€™re a student or early-career professional, please reach out. <b>I always make time for students for free.</b></summary><br></p>
<p>I frequently have conversations about how to negotiate the salary for your first big job or how to figure out the best way to learn abstract/complex skills so they stick.</details></p>
<h2>ðŸ›  Process</h2>
<p>My expertise tends toward the following:
<details><summary><b>Data &amp; Engineering</b></summary><br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data modeling and database architecture</strong> - Working with stakeholders so we can best represent data within a relational or semi-structured datastore</li>
<li><strong>Data pipelines design and architecture</strong> - Using my preferred cloud environment AWS, building a toolkit to take data from one source, process it, and store in some form</li>
<li><strong>Web application design</strong> - Building a frontend that sits on top of a database and allows for data interrogation with visualizations or reporting. My expertise here is in Django/Flask.</li>
<li><strong>Initial UI/UX of applications</strong> - Working with stakeholders to identify the core feature set of an application, and represent it in a form which can be handed off to designers
</details></li>
</ul>
<p><details><summary><b>Information Organization &amp; Communication</b></summary><br></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information architecture</strong> - In case youâ€™re trying to organize a body of information for consistency or ease of access, I have experience doing that. I also have experience crafting niche taxonomies/categorizing systems for machine learning classification projects.</li>
<li><strong>Instructional design</strong> - As an ESL teacher &amp; data science professional, I have experience building curricula and producing engaging learning materials for students. I can also provide some edited lecture materials on request to demonstrate my experience teaching a class.</li>
<li><strong>Career advising</strong> - If youâ€™re an early career professional and youâ€™re looking for some engagement about how to get your first data science-related job, I can review your materials and help you position yourself; Iâ€™ve successfully helped people negotiate for double-digit percentage increases in their salary during hiring or raises, and will provide contact info for reference if requested.
</details></li>
</ul>
