        <b>ü§î Problem Space</b>
        <p>I participated in a video contest for the iConference,
          a global consortium of information schools. The goal was to make a
          promotional video explaining the relevance of iSchools.</p>
          <p>I won second place. My project was the only entry produced
            by an individual.</p>
            <p class="tldr">The prize was a lump sum of cash and an expenses-paid trip
              to the conference in Philadelphia that year. I consider attending
            this conference as one of the reasons I elected to pursue a Masters degree.</p>

        <b>üìù Process</b>
            <p>As a challenge, I made the video exclusively using three pieces of software:
              Keynote, iMovie, and Ableton Live. I made simple keyframe animations
              using Keynote and then cut them together in iMovie.</p>
              <img class="tldr" width="480" height="270" src="./img/ischool-1.png">
              <p class="tldr">I was inspired by a video about AI from the philosophy
              of Nick Bostrom, a video by Radiolab about
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEQskIsHKT8">symmetry</a>,
            and a video about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLcFAI5SZg">
                explanation of relativity</a> by a young physicist. I also
              collected a series of simple animated GIFs whose aesthetics
              I found simple, yet compelling.</p>
              <img class="tldr" width="480" height="270" src="./img/ischool-2.png">
              <p class="tldr">I also made the background music to accompany
              and score the video using an analog synthesizer I had at the time.
            I initially wrote the music and did sound design for the video in Ableton Live
          and recorded the voiceovers and other cues alongside the video using my synth.</p>
          <p>It took me about two weeks (from conceptualization to finalized script)
            to complete this video. I did it during evenings and a couple of weekends
            while working full-time.</p>
