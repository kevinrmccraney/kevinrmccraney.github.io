<h2>ü§î Problem Space</h2>
<p>I participated in a video contest for the iConference, a global consortium of information schools. The goal was to make a promotional video explaining the relevance of iSchools. I won second place. My project was the only entry produced by an individual.</p>
<p>The prize was a lump sum of cash and an expenses-paid trip to the conference in Philadelphia that year. I consider attending this conference as one of the reasons I elected to pursue a Masters degree.</p>
<h2>üìù Process</h2>
<p>As a challenge, I made the video exclusively using three pieces of software: Keynote, iMovie, and Ableton Live. I made simple keyframe animations using Keynote and then cut them together in iMovie.</p>

<p>I was inspired by a video about AI from the philosophy of Nick Bostrom, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEQskIsHKT8">a video by Radiolab about symmetry</a>, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umLcFAI5SZg">video about the explanation of relativity by a young physicist</a>. I also collected a series of simple animated GIFs whose aesthetics I found simple, yet compelling.</p>

<p>I also made the background music to accompany and score the video using an analog synthesizer I had at the time.</p>
<p>I initially wrote the music and did sound design for the video in Ableton Live and recorded the voiceovers and other cues alongside the video using my synth.</p>
<p>It took me about two weeks (from conceptualization to finalized script) to complete this video. I did it during evenings and a couple of weekends while working full-time.</p>
