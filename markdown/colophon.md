## ü§î What is a colophon?
A colophon is essentially a statement containing the information about the publication of a text.

I used to see blogs that shared this information, but never knew what it meant--they usually documented their choice of typography and other stuff, which seemed weird and irrelevant to me. We're in the age of hypertext and the process behind writing has changed significantly, so why refer back to old forms?

To reimagine what a colophon does, I'll cite all of the sites that inspired the design of this one. The more influential sites are stacked toward the top.

If you're on this list and happen to see this page, I'd love to talk to you.
