My small corner of the internet has had several different forms, beginning in maybe 2013-2014 when I first published something to GitHub to document my learning journey of data science. Now I have this simple page--it's only sporadically updated, but the design is straightforward, works across platforms, and is imminently thinkable because it's written in simple HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

But really, it's written in Markdown. && I decided at a certain point that I wanted to make it as frictionless as I could to write something and get it up on the web, while still being able to use the command line and git to produce the project. That way I don't have to log in to anything--it's local to live all the time. &&

There are a couple of different things which enable this:

1. Hosting the site on someone else's computer (Microsoft/GitHub)
2. Automated actions when a commit is made to the repo
3. A custom markdown parser that I wrote

## && Why write a custom parser for your blog? &&

One of my central theses is that as the internet becomes more of a dark forest and there is consolidation of platforms, it is important to understand and control something which resembles the means of production. There are so many layers of abstraction that knowing how everything works perfectly is a quixotic undertaking (reality has a surprising amount of detail), but being able to think through exactly what you need and deliver on it makes you a better thinker.

I like to think of this as a mediocre woodworker building a mediocre chair. Being the best doesn't matter; looking at the world differently does. This proverbial person may not be the best craftsperson, but the skills they gain from trying to create order from chaos (or wood, as the case may be) is more important than the final project is.

Or, as they say at Daptone Records, shitty is pretty.
