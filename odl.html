        ðŸŒƒ Open Data Literacy Internship: NLP on Public Records
      </div>
      <div class="section bio">
        <p>The final analysis that I produced is available on GitHub,
          hosted in an interactive Jupyter notebook with Binder. You can

        <b>ðŸ¤” Problem Space</b>
        <p>For eight weeks in summer 2018, I worked for the City of Seattle and
          the State of Washington on an open data-related project.
          The scope of the internship was to support data literacy for people
          in the public sector.</p>

          <p class="tldr">My partner and I collaborated on creating a governance document for an
          open data-related paraprofessional organization.
          In parallel, I spent time analyzing trends in public records requests
          to support proactive disclosure of datasets.</p>

          <p>The project had two parts: data analysis and a policy document.
          I was in charge of the data analysis.</p>

          <p>Throughout the project, we also wrote about our experience. You can view
            some reflections <a href="https://medium.com/open-data-literacy/improving-user-experience-for-public-records-requests-be311e302b7a">here</a>
            and <a href="https://medium.com/open-data-literacy/summarizing-a-summer-devoted-to-data-6cf7f68f29a1">here</a>.

            <b>ðŸ›  Process</b>
            <p class="tldr">We began by interviewing a number of different records professionals.
            We collected their names through the snowball sampling method. We spoke with
          for about an hour each, then performed thematic analysis based on our notes and
        coded transcripts, which you can view in <a href="https://github.com/OpenDataLiteracy/OpenDataAlliance-KM/tree/master/thematic-clustering-sessions">this
          repo</a>. We sought to better understand the needs and expectations
        of data professionals that might be involved in the organization,</p>

              <p class="tldr">Once we identified the themes, my partner and I
                collaboratively drafted a document that acted as a charter for the organization,
                outlining the expectations for participants.
              open data-related paraprofessional organization.</p>

        <p>I began with three datasets from different municipalities across Western Washington.
          I researched current techniques in natural language
          processing and clustering algorithms,
          building a data processing pipeline and visualization toolkit.</p>
          <p class="tldr">The end-goal was for Open Data Champions
          (people that work with open data) to
          use the platform to ingest, process, and comprehend their data better.</p>

      <b>ðŸŽ‰ Outcomes</b>
        <p>We traveled to Olympia to meet with some of the partners who
          helped facilitate the internship. We also presented our work for discussion,
          which you can see here.</p>
