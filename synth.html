        <b>ü§î Problem Space</b>
        <p>My teammates and I built a photocell theremin and reactive light device for our physical computing course. We called
        it the Protek Audioino, after our initials rearranged (<b>Pro</b>shonjit, <b>T</b>iffany, and <b>Ke</b>vin).</p>

        <img class="figure" src="./img/synth-1.png">
        <p>This is a model of how all the parts of the system interact.</p>

        <p class="tldr">The device we built provides an exciting experience for musical performance.
          Our prototype combines electronic sensors with sound and a visual component.
          The central hub or server of our system is a granular synthesizer.
          Manipulating the knobs on the synthesizer alters the tone and pitch of the sound being created.
          Additionally, we have included an accompanying visual display using an LED strip.
          The visual display responds with light patterns according to the sound from the synthesizer via a microphone sensor.</p>

        <p class="tldr">The granular synthesizer or ‚Äúcontroller‚Äù in our system
          uses pulse with modulation to convert a series of numbers into sound,
          which we have amplified with a speaker. The potentiometer controls
          some of the different oscillators such as timbre and tone. The
          photocell resistor is the pitch controller. The pitch changes based
          on the amount of light the photocell resistor receives.</p>

          <p class="tldr">For our visual
          display, we are using a microphone amp sensor to capture the sound from the
          synthesizer and trigger different light patterns to appear on the LED strip.
          We also added a potentiometer to control the light sensitivity of the LED strip.</p>

          <b>‚úã Initial Intervention</b>
              <p>We intended to incorporate wearable gloves and gyroscopes in our system.</p>

              <p class="tldr">Gyroscope sensors were attached
              to the gloves along with xBees for wireless communication to and from the
              granular synthesizer. User movement from the gloves would control the synthesizer,
              and trigger the lights in turn, as if the performer was conducting in front
              of an orchestra.</p>

              <p>We made the light component of the system first, because it required
                the least user interaction.</p>

            <b>üé® Design & Refine</b>
            <p class="tldr">We had to refine our scope several times. Initially, we intended to
            incorporate wearable gloves in our system. Gyroscope sensors were attached
            to the gloves along with xBees for wireless communication to and from the
            granular synthesizer. User movement from the gloves would control the synthesizer,
            and trigger the lights in turn, as if the performer was conducting in front
            of an orchestra.</p>

            <p class="tldr">While we were able to get the wearable component working, we didn‚Äôt
            anticipate the difficulty in mapping the raw data from the gyroscope output
            and converting those numbers into a usable range to trigger notes on the synthesizer.
            We also experience pulse width modulation interference between the XBee sensors
            and gyroscopes that we used.</p>

            <p>After many problems, (including a gyroscope overheating and catching fire üë®‚ÄçüöíüßØüî•)
              we decided to use potentiometers and a photocell resistor for the synth. Adding a photocell
              resistor provided a similar experience to what we were trying to prototype with the gyroscope sensors.</p>

              <p>Proshonjit and I spent a lot of time in the lab debugging and soldering. Tiffany's not pictured
              (she's taking the photos!) but worked just as hard.</p>
