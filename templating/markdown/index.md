## About Me
I am a graduate of the University of Washington's MSIM program, specializing in data science, user experience, and information architecture. If you'd like to hire me as a consultant, [here are some of the things I can do](/hire-me.html).

<details><summary>Here's my [bio](./bio.html) and a [professional timeline](./timeline.html).</summary> I'm interested in music, teaching methods, the history of technology, community building, design, economics, and other such things.

I strive to make the oblique transparent and the abstract concrete. If that line sounds familiar, I might have used it on you in an interview or something. I identify as "personally introverted, professionally extroverted."</details>
