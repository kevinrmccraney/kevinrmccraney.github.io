<details><summary>My site here is many things--some surface area for myself on the internet, a way to reach out to others. But, above all else, it's written in Markdown.</summary><br>I decided at a certain point that I wanted to make it as frictionless as I could to write something and get it up on the web, while still being able to use the command line and git to produce the project. That way I don't have to log in to anything--it's local to live all the time.</details>

There are a couple of different things which enable this:

1. Hosting the site on someone else's computer (Microsoft/GitHub)
2. Automated actions when a commit is made to the repo
3. A custom markdown parser that I wrote

<details><summary>My small corner of the internet has had several different forms, and this is probably not the final one it will take.</summary><br>

Back in the heady days of AOL, I had an Angelfire web page, where I ran a paper-and-pencil RPG for my friends at school. Beginning in 2013 or 2014, I first published something to GitHub to document my learning journey of data science. Now I have this simple page--it's only sporadically updated, but the design is straightforward, works across platforms, and is imminently thinkable because it's written in simple HTML/CSS and JavaScript.</details>

## What's with the weird little button in the corner?
My <button disabled title="This one doesn't work! Use the corner one!" style="cursor:not-allowed;">tl;dr</button> button is how you get some quick summaries to my occasionally excessive writing. It doesn't work on every page, because some pages are short by default--you can't summarize everything.

## Why write a custom parser for your blog?

<details><summary>I think it's important to have a silly little place where you can do a silly little thing. Many people I respect describe software as something which can be homespun, built out by hobbyists, intentionally not scaled for the masses, and I believe this at my core too.</summary><br>

What follows are a collection of different ideas on this theme, some by me and some by others:

 - [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/) is the originator of the "software-as-home-cooked-meal" as far as I know.

 - Sometimes being the best doesn't matter; it's more about the act of producing something. When I work on this blog, I'm a mediocre woodworker building a mediocre chair--the skills I gain from trying to create order from chaos (or wood, as the case may be) are more important than the final project itself. As they say at Daptone Records, [shitty is pretty](https://www.funkydown.com/downloads/shitty2.pdf).

 - One of my central theses is that as the internet becomes more of a [dark forest](https://www.ystrickler.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet/) and consolidation of platforms occurs, it is important to understand and control something which resembles the means of production.

 - There are so many layers of abstraction that knowing how everything works perfectly is a quixotic undertaking. Reality has a surprising amount of information in it, and comprehending it at all levels is impossible; but being able to think through exactly what you need and deliver on it makes you a better thinker.
