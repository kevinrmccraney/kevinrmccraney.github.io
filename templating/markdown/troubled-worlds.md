## ðŸ¤” Problem Space
<details><summary>During my time in graduate school, I participated in a multi-quarter research project focused on design for the Anthropocene.</summary><br>

The research project was structured as a reading group. In the first half of the project, we would read an excerpt from a large text or a handful of papers on a theme, and then come together and talk through our takeaways.</details>

## ðŸ›  Process
<details><summary>Initially, I was curious about two overarching questions: is data, as an encoded artifact, materialized ideology; and has anyone ever calculated the energy consumption of performing basic office tasks using a computer?</summary><br>

Ultimately this led me into doing research about the nature of calculating/computing/documenting information using [calculated values](https://news.mit.edu/2018/book-statistical-arguments-public-debate-0205) via the book of the same name, as well as various projects focused on low-resource computing.

When the research project was running, it was my duty to introduce these ideas to other folks by leading a discussion section focused on these topics. We met on a weekly basis and we had to lead discussion sessions focused on the research we had done in the previous week.</details>

## ðŸŽ‰ Outcomes
<details><summary>I concluded my participation in the group by writing a module on power consumption for the syllabus we produced. You can view [our published curriculum here](https://doi.org/10.24242/jclis.v3i1.137).</summary><br>

The outcome of the project was an undergraduate curriculum focused on some of the different emergent themes of the group--situated design, adaptation to the environment, energy consumption, supply chains, and repair.
