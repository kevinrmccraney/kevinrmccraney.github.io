            <h1>üåè About This Site</h1>
            <p><details><summary>My site here is many things--some surface area for myself on the internet, a way to reach out to others. But, above all else, it's written in Markdown.</summary><br>I decided at a certain point that I wanted to make it as frictionless as I could to write something and get it up on the web, while still being able to use the command line and git to produce the project. That way I don't have to log in to anything--it's local to live all the time.</details></p>
<p>There are a couple of different things which enable this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hosting the site on someone else's computer (Microsoft/GitHub)</li>
<li>Automated actions when a commit is made to the repo</li>
<li>A custom markdown parser that I wrote</li>
</ol>
<p><details><summary>My small corner of the internet has had several different forms, and this is probably not the final one it will take.</summary><br></p>
<p>Back in the heady days of AOL, I had an Angelfire web page, where I ran a paper-and-pencil RPG for my friends at school. Beginning in 2013 or 2014, I first published something to GitHub to document my learning journey of data science. Now I have this simple page--it's only sporadically updated, but the design is straightforward, works across platforms, and is imminently thinkable because it's written in simple HTML/CSS and JavaScript.</details></p>
<h2>What's with the weird little button in the corner?</h2>
<p>My <button disabled title="This one doesn't work! Use the corner one!" style="cursor:not-allowed;">tl;dr</button> button is how you get some quick summaries to my occasionally excessive writing. It doesn't work on every page, because some pages are short by default--you can't summarize everything.</p>
<h2>Why write a custom parser for your blog?</h2>
<p><details><summary>I think it's important to have a silly little place where you can do a silly little thing. Many people I respect describe software as something which can be homespun, built out by hobbyists, intentionally not scaled for the masses, and I believe this at my core too.</summary><br></p>
<p>What follows are a collection of different ideas on this theme, some by me and some by others:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/">Robin Sloan</a> is the originator of the "software-as-home-cooked-meal" as far as I know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes being the best doesn't matter; it's more about the act of producing something. When I work on this blog, I'm a mediocre woodworker building a mediocre chair--the skills I gain from trying to create order from chaos (or wood, as the case may be) are more important than the final project itself. As they say at Daptone Records, <a href="https://www.funkydown.com/downloads/shitty2.pdf">shitty is pretty</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of my central theses is that as the internet becomes more of a <a href="https://www.ystrickler.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet/">dark forest</a> and consolidation of platforms occurs, it is important to understand and control something which resembles the means of production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are so many layers of abstraction that knowing how everything works perfectly is a quixotic undertaking. Reality has a surprising amount of information in it, and comprehending it at all levels is impossible; but being able to think through exactly what you need and deliver on it makes you a better thinker.
