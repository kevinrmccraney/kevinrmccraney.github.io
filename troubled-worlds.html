        ðŸŒƒ Troubled Worlds Curriculum Design

        <b>ðŸ¤” Problem Space</b>
        <p>During my time in graduate school, I participated in a multi-quarter research project focused on design for the Anthropocene.</p>

<p class="tldr">The research project was structured as a reading group. In the first half of the project, we would read an excerpt from a large text or a handful of papers on a theme, and then come together and talk through our takeaways.</p>

          <div class="section bio">
            <b>ðŸ›  Process</b>
            <p class="tldr">Initially, I was curious about two overarching questions: is data, as an encoded artifact, materialized ideology; and has anyone ever calculated the energy consumption of performing basic office tasks?</p><p>When the research project was running, it was my duty to introduce these ideas to other folks by leading a discussion section focused on these topics.</p>

      <div class="section bio">
      <b>ðŸŽ‰ Outcomes</b>
      <p class="tldr">The outcome of the project was an undergraduate curriculum focused on some of the different emergent themes of the group--situated design, adaptation to the environment, energy consumption, supply chains, and repair.</p>
<p>I concluded my participation in the group by writing a module on power consumption for the syllabus we produced. You can view our <a href="https://doi.org/10.24242/jclis.v3i1.137">published curriculum here</a>.</p>
