            <h2>ðŸ¤” Problem Space</h2>
<p><details><summary>During my time in graduate school, I participated in a multi-quarter research project focused on design for the Anthropocene.</summary><br></p>
<p>The research project was structured as a reading group. In the first half of the project, we would read an excerpt from a large text or a handful of papers on a theme, and then come together and talk through our takeaways.</details></p>
<h2>ðŸ›  Process</h2>
<p><details><summary>Initially, I was curious about two overarching questions: is data, as an encoded artifact, materialized ideology; and has anyone ever calculated the energy consumption of performing basic office tasks using a computer?</summary><br></p>
<p>Ultimately this led me into doing research about the nature of calculating/computing/documenting information using <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/book-statistical-arguments-public-debate-0205">calculated values</a> via the book of the same name, as well as various projects focused on low-resource computing.</p>
<p>When the research project was running, it was my duty to introduce these ideas to other folks by leading a discussion section focused on these topics. We met on a weekly basis and we had to lead discussion sessions focused on the research we had done in the previous week.</details></p>
<h2>ðŸŽ‰ Outcomes</h2>
<p><details><summary>I concluded my participation in the group by writing a module on power consumption for the syllabus we produced. You can view <a href="https://doi.org/10.24242/jclis.v3i1.137">our published curriculum here</a>.</summary><br></p>
<p>The outcome of the project was an undergraduate curriculum focused on some of the different emergent themes of the group--situated design, adaptation to the environment, energy consumption, supply chains, and repair.
